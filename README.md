# Movie-Recommendation-System-
An end-to-end Movie Recommendation System Application.
Used the tmdb-5000 movies dataset for this project. It contains 5000 movies along with their genres, cast, actors, producers, credits, etc.
My Recommender model takes a movie title as input and predicts top-n most similar movies based on the tag. 
Here I will use the concept of Cosine similarity to calculate the similarity of tags.
